
Software flow:
-Configure the Information object from JSON or XML
  - Read data into the Observation object
  - Create Location objects and add Subpopulation objects
  - Initialize all Subpopulation objects
        - Add a pointer to the Observation object
        - Define submodels(growth, recruitment, immigration, emigration, etc) from CSTAR
        - Initialize all independent variables(including those in vector, or matrix containers)
            -Register estimable parameters to the Information object
        - Initialize all dependent variable vectors and matrices
  - Add Location objects to the Model object
  - Begin fit procedure (concurrently if possible)
  - Write population analysis results
  - Characterize uncertainty and write 
  - Do model projection
  - Evaluate management strategy
  - Generate pdf report


General Goal of Development:
Write generic portable code for MAS components and keep them separate from any 
minimizer libraries such as ADMB and ATL. This will help ensure maintainability
and allow for efficient upgrades if necessary. Try to use standard library 
containers when possible.


Notes about MAS objects:

Location class:
-Areas are defined as polygons? This may be useful for movement in complex
areas. Perhaps future ancestors of the location class may contain hard boundaries
where fish cannot cross, like in reef structures.
