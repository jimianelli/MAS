
Software flow:
-Configure the Information object
  - Read data into the Observation object
  - Create Location objects and add Subpopulation objects
  - Initialize all Subpopulation objects
        - Add a pointer to the Observation object
        - Define submodels(growth, recruitment, immigration, emigration, etc) from CSTAR
        - Initialize all vectors and matrices
  - Add Location objects to the Model object
  - Begin fit procedure (concurrently if using ATL)
  - Write population analysis results
  - Characterize uncertainty and write 
  - Do model projection
  - Evaluate management strategy
  - Generate pdf report




Location class:
-Areas are defined as polygons? This may be useful for movement in complex
areas. Perhaps future ancestors of the location class may contain hard boundaries
where fish cannot cross, like in reef structures.
